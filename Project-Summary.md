# Project Summary

# System Overview
I created a complete backend system that lets the colleges manage their events and keep track of everything at one single place. It handles everything from creating events to generating useful reports.

# Frameworks Used 

Used Node.js/Express as it works well with API's. SQLite because it is easy for testing. A simple database with College_id sepration to keep it simple.

# Scale handling

Built for 50 colleges- 500 students - 20 events. Used auto increment ID's that are unique.


# Working 

-For Admins: They can create events, see what is popular and can track the attendance.

-For Students: They can browse the events, register for them, and can also provide the feedbacks and ratings.

Finally everyone can see the reports that show what's working well.

# Technical Achievements

-All the API's work smoothly
-The Database relationships are solid
-Reports generate accurate data
-It can be handled at the required scale 

# Challenges I Overcame
The database relationships were tricky at first, then i figured out how all of them connect, which took some time and I faced many errors, but I was able to understand and fix them. I also faced challenges with the reports, but was able to overcome them.

# The System outputs

The reporting system works really well. It can show:
-Which are the most popular events
-How many Students are participating 
-Attendance rates for each of the events
-Ratings and Feedbacks
-Top-Active Students across colleges

# Future Improvements

This can also be improved by the additional features like,
-User authentication system
-Email remainders for the events
-The frontend interface
-More advanced reporting features
